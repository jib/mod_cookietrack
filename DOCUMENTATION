### Introduction
######################

This module is a drop-in replacement for mod_usertrack (which can be
found here: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_usertrack.html)
and aims to fix a lot of the issues with it. In no particular order:

* Rolling expires

  mod_usertrack will set the expires value once and forget about it,
  meaning that if the original period expires, you will have lost the
  users token and must generate a new one.

  mod_cookietrack addresses this by updating the expires value in a
  rolling fashion; whenever a user comes back, their cookie is re-set
  with the new expires window.

* Setting cookie on incoming request

  mod_usertrack does not set the cookie on the incoming request, only
  on the outgoing request. This means your application doesn't know
  what UUID to use for the first visit of a user.

  mod_cookietrack addresses this by setting a 'Cookie:' header on the
  incoming request if it's not already set, allowing your application
  to transparently do the right thing.

* Support for X-Forwarded-For (or alternate header)

  mod_usertrack's UUID format is 'ClientIP.TimeStamp'; if the client
  ip is a loadbalancer, or some other frontend end device, this will
  always be the same IP (for example, 10.0.0.1) and does not add to
  the uniqueness of the UUID.

  mod_cookietrack addresses this by optionally looking at the a header
  of your choosing (the industry standard is 'X-Forwarded-For') and
  using the right most IP in that to determine the remote IP.

* Support for non 2xx response codes

  mod_usertrack only sets cookies on outgoing responses that are in the
  2xx family; if your application returns a 302 for example, no cookie
  is set.

  mod_cookietrack addresses this by setting a cookie on all outgoing
  responses, including 3xx, 4xx and 5xx.

* Support for setting incoming & outgoing custom header

  mod_usertrack only sets the outgoing cookie, making it impossible to
  hash user content, or ease logging outside of Apache based on the UUID
  generated. Inside Apache you can use the 'note' that is set with the
  UUID.

  mod_cookietrack addresses this by optionally setting and incoming and
  outgoing header, which can be used to hash the request/response as well
  as log the UUID more easily outside Apache, without needing to parse the
  cookie header.

* Do Not Track support (configurable)

  mod_usertrack does not offer any support for Do Not Track (see here for
  a definition: http://dnt.mozilla.org/) and will set cookies regardless
  of the users Do Not Track settings.

  mod_cookietrack addresses this by looking at the Do Not Track header
  that is sent by the client and setting a "DNT" cookie with fixed expiry
  value, making this an untrackable cookie. It still sets a cookie because
  it is not possible to access the value of the Do Not Track header in
  JavaScript from most browsers yet.

  Note: this is the only addition that changes the behaviour compared to
  mod_usertrack: Do Not Track will be complied with by default, you can
  turn it off if you insist.

* External UID library support

  mod_usertrack uses a simple 'IPAdress.TimeStamp' format for it's UUIDs,
  but in some cases your site may demand a more sophistaced UUID generation
  algorithm.

  mod_cookietrack addresses this by letting you optionally link to a custom
  library to generate the UUID. See the README for details on how to do this.

### Configuration
######################

Note: This module is a drop-in replacement for mod_usertrack, so all the
configuration options mentioned in its documentation work as expected:

  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_usertrack.html

Note: All the directives can be either set in the server config, virtual host,
directory or .htaccess sections of the configuration.

The first section below is all the options that are supported by mod_usertrack
as well as mod_cookietrack. The second section will have mod_cookietrack specific
configuration directives only.

*** CookieDomain directive
    Syntax:     CookieDomain domain
    Default:    NULL

    This directive controls the setting of the domain to which the tracking cookie
    applies. If not present, no domain is included in the cookie header field.

    The domain string must begin with a dot, and must include at least one embedded dot.
    That is, .example.com is legal, but foo.example.com and .com are not.

    Most browsers in use today will not allow cookies to be set for a two-part top level
    domain, such as .co.uk, although such a domain ostensibly fulfills the requirements
    above. These domains are equivalent to top level domains such as .com, and allowing
    such cookies may be a security risk. Thus, if you are under a two-part top level
    domain, you should still use your actual domain, as you would with any other top level
    domain (for example, use .foo.co.uk).

*** CookieExpires directive
    Syntax:     CookieExpires expiry-period
    Default:    NULL

    When used, this directive sets an expiry time on the cookie generated by the usertrack
    module. The expiry-period can be given either as a number of seconds, or in the format
    such as "2 weeks 3 days 7 hours". Valid denominations are: years, months, weeks, days,
    hours, minutes and seconds. If the expiry time is in any format other than one number
    indicating the number of seconds, it must be enclosed by double quotes.

    If this directive is not used, cookies last only for the current browser session.

*** CookieName directive
    Syntax:     CookieName token
    Default:    CookieName Apache

    This directive allows you to change the name of the cookie this module uses for its
    tracking purposes. By default the cookie is named "Apache".

    You must specify a valid cookie name; results are unpredictable if you use a name
    containing unusual characters. Valid characters include A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "_", and "-".

*** CookieStyle directive
    Syntax:     CookieStyle Netscape|Cookie|Cookie2|RFC2109|RFC2965
    Default:    CookieStyle Netscape

    This directive controls the format of the cookie header field. The three formats
    allowed are:

    * Netscape, which is the original but now deprecated syntax. This is the default,
      and the syntax Apache has historically used.
    * Cookie or RFC2109, which is the syntax that superseded the Netscape syntax.
    * Cookie2 or RFC2965, which is the most current cookie syntax.

    Not all clients can understand all of these formats, but you should use the newest one
    that is generally acceptable to your users browsers. At the time of writing, most
    browsers only fully support CookieStyle Netscape.

*** CookieTracking directive
    Syntax:     CookieTracking on|off
    Default:    CookieTracking off

    When mod_cookietrack is loaded, and CookieTracking on is set, Apache will send a
    user-tracking cookie for all new requests. This directive can be used to turn this
    behavior on or off on a per-server or per-directory basis. By default, enabling
    mod_cookietrack will not activate cookies.


Below are the extended configuration options available in mod_cookietrack, that are
not supported by mod_usertrack:

*** CookieDNTComply directive
    Syntax:     CookieDNTComply on|off
    Default:    CookieDNTComply on

    This directive controls whether mod_cookietrack will set a fixed string DNT
    cookie if the "Do Not Track" header is present. If you wish to ignore the
    "Do Not Track" header, or be completely backwards compatible with mod_usertrack,
    set this directive to off.

    Note it's considered good industry practice to comply with Do Not Track and we
    urge you to leave this directive enabled. It's exposure is purely for backwards
    compatibility.

*** CookieDNTValue directive
    Syntax:     CookieDNTValue String
    Default:    CookieDNTValue DNT

    This directive controls the value of the "Do Not Track" cookie. The industry
    standard is to use "DNT", but it can be any fixed string.

*** CookieNoteName directive
    Syntax:     CookieNoteName Name
    Default:    CookieNoteName cookie

    This directive controls the Apache 'note' name you want to use for The
    generated UUID. For backwards compatibility, the default is 'cookie',
    which is the value mod_usertrack used. You can set this to any valid
    string. You can access this in your CustomLog format using: %{cookie}n.

*** CookieIPHeader directive
    Syntax:     CookieIPHeader Header-Name
    Default:    NULL

    This directive let's you specify which other header field to inspect for the
    remote ip, rather than just using the RemoteIP Apache exposes (%a in logs);
    if your Apache is behind an HTTP cache or loadbalancer, the RemoteIP reported
    will be that off the cache/loadbalancer, not that of the end user.

    In that case, you'll want to use the CookieIPHeader directive. The industry
    standard is to use 'X-Forwarded-For', but your cache/loadbalancer may set a
    different header. mod_cookietrack understands that this can be a comma seperated
    list and uses the right most IP in this header to mean the client ip. Example:

        CookieIPHeader 'X-Forwarded-For'

*** CookieSendHeader directive
    Syntax:     CookieSendHeader on|off
    Default:    CookieSendHeader off

    This directive controls whether mod_cookietrack should set an additional
    incoming & outgoing header with the generated UUID. This can be used for
    more efficient hashing for caches/routing, as well as simplified logging
    outside of Apache, where you don't have access to it's 'notes' feature.

*** CookieHeaderName directive
    Syntax:     CookieHeaderName Header-Name
    Default:    CookieHeaderName X-UUID

    This directive controls the value of the header mod_cookietrack sets. It
    can be any valid HTTP header name of your choosing and will be set on the
    incoming and outgoing request.
